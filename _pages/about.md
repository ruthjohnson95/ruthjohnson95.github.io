About
======

Hi, my name is Ruthie (Ruth) Johnson, and I'm currently a second year computer science PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles working with [Sriram Sankararaman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/) and [Bogdan Pasaniuc](https://bogdan.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/). I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and genetics. 

Previously, I worked on deep learning applications in genome sequencing at Illumina and as an R&D intern at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM.
